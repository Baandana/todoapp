# Todoapp
----------------------------------------------
This Android todo app is developed using Java and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. MVVM is a widely accepted software architecture pattern that addresses the limitations of previous design patterns like MVP and MVC. The main principle of MVVM is to separate the presentation logic of data (Views or UI) from the underlying business logic of the application. This allows for better organization and maintainability of the codebase, as well as easier testing and debugging.
